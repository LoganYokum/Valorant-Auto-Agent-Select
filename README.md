# ValorantAutoSelect
Written in Python3

## What is this?
This is a simple script that will automatically select the agent you want to play in Valorant. It will also automatically lock in the agent for you.

## How to use
Download Python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (I am using version 3.11.3) from the time I created this script.

Make sure you have the required modules installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal (make sure it has executable permissions):
```./requirements.sh```

In a command prompt, run the following command:
```python3 script.py```

The program will run until you press and HOLD the space key. Upon this, the program will autoselect to the agent you selected.

You can change the agent you wish to play, the speed it pick the agent, and the speed it checks if the key is pressed. You can do this by editing the script.py values in the file.
